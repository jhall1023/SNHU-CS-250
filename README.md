-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By asking concise and precise questions I can interpret user needs and work to implement them into a program. Many times there needs to be effective communication when questions arise and by ensuring clarification to the user needs there are no miscommunions. User stories help with this by allowing for clear direction when it comes to implementing the user needs.  

-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When approaching developing programs I need to follow the agile methodology. This allows for a very customer focused development mindset with a focus on responding to change and working software. I hope to incorporate all of these processes into my future development work. Keeping the customer as the main focus as well as developing working software and responding well to change will be an asset to any development project moving forward. 

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

What it means to be a good team member in software development is to be a great communicator. There is so much going on within the team you need to be able to communicate well with other team members. The team needs to be a safe and comfortable place where all members feel appreciated, valued, and able to share their input. A great team member works to deal with any problems upfront and be able to take any constructive criticism.
